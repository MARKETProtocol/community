MARKET Protocol has been created to provide a secure, flexible, open source foundation for decentralized trading on the Ethereum blockchain. We provide the pieces necessary to create a decentralized exchange, including the requisite clearing and collateral pool infrastructure, enabling third parties to build applications for trading.
